The following archives are projects and code examples written in R.

The language is similar to MATLAB (or so I've heard), but I find it pretty difficult to do simple programming tasks. The basic problem I had was trying to wrap my head around the fact that every "primitive" data type is a "vector".

I am committing examples here while using "R Cookbook" by O'Reilly books as a reference material.
